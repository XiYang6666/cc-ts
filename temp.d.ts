/**
 * Convert between streams of DFPWM audio data and a list of amplitudes.
 *
 * DFPWM (Dynamic Filter Pulse Width Modulation) is an audio codec designed by GreaseMonkey.
 * It's a relatively compact format compared to raw PCM data, only using 1 bit per sample,
 * but is simple enough to encode and decode in real time.
 *
 * Typically DFPWM audio is read from the filesystem or a a web request as a string,
 * and converted a format suitable for `speaker.playAudio`.
 *
 * ### Encoding and decoding files
 * This module exposes two key functions, {@link make_decoder} and {@link make_encoder},
 * which construct a new decoder or encoder. The returned encoder/decoder is itself a function,
 * which converts between the two kinds of data.
 *
 * These encoders and decoders have lots of hidden state, so you should be careful to use the
 * same encoder or decoder for a specific audio stream. Typically you will want to create a
 * decoder for each stream of audio you read, and an encoder for each one you write.
 *
 * ### Converting audio to DFPWM
 * DFPWM is not a popular file format and so standard audio processing tools may not have an
 * option to export to it. Instead, you can convert audio files online using `music.madefor.cc`,
 * the `LionRay Wav Converter` Java application or `FFmpeg 5.1` or later.
 *
 * @example
 * - Reads "data/example.dfpwm" in chunks, decodes them and then doubles the speed of the audio.
 *   The resulting audio is then re-encoded and saved to "speedy.dfpwm".
 *   This processed audio can then be played with the speaker program.
 * ```ts
 * import * as dfpwm from "cc.audio.dfpwm";
 *
 * const encoder = dfpwm.make_encoder();
 * const decoder = dfpwm.make_decoder();
 *
 * const [out] = fs.open("speedy.dfpwm", "wb");
 * if (out) {
 *   for (const input of io.lines("data/example.dfpwm", 16 * 1024 * 2)) {
 *     const decoded = decoder(input);
 *     const output: number[] = [];
 *
 *     // Read two samples at once and take the average.
 *     for (let i = 0; i < decoded.length; i += 2) {
 *       const value_1 = decoded[i];
 *       const value_2 = decoded[i + 1];
 *       // If decoded.length is odd, value_2 will be undefined. Average value_1 with itself.
 *       output[Math.floor((i + 1) / 2)] = (value_1 + (value_2 ?? value_1)) / 2;
 *     }
 *
 *     out.write(encoder(output));
 *
 *     sleep(0); // This program takes a while to run, so we need to make sure we yield.
 *   }
 *   out.close();
 * }
 * ```
