   * buffer is full, this function will return `false`. Programs should wait for
   * a `speaker_audio_empty` event before trying to play audio again.
   *
   * The speaker only buffers a single call to `playAudio` at once. This means
   * if you try to play a small number of samples, you'll have a lot of stutter.
   * You should try to play as many samples in one call as possible (up to
   * 128Ã—1024), as this reduces the chances of audio stuttering or halting,
   * especially when the server or computer is lagging.
   *
   * While the speaker accepts 8-bit PCM audio, the audio stream is re-encoded
   * before being played. This means that the supplied samples may not be played
   * out exactly.
