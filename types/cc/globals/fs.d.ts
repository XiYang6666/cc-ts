/**
 * Interact with the computer's files and filesystem, allowing you to manipulate
 * files, directories and paths.
 *
 * This includes:
 * - Reading and writing files: Call {@link fs.open} to obtain a file "handle",
 *   which can be used to read from or write to a file.
 * - Path manipulation: {@link fs.combine}, {@link fs.getName} and
 *   {@link fs.getDir} allow you to manipulate file paths, joining them together
 *   or extracting components.
 * - Querying paths: For instance, checking if a file exists, or whether it's a
 *   directory. See {@link fs.getSize}, {@link fs.exists}, {@link fs.isDir},
 *   {@link fs.isReadOnly} and {@link fs.attributes}.
 * - File and directory manipulation: For instance, moving or copying files. See
 *   {@link fs.makeDir}, {@link fs.move}, {@link fs.copy} and {@link fs.delete}.
 *
 * > [!NOTE] All functions in the API work on absolute paths, and do not take
 * the current directory into account. You can use `shell.resolve` to convert a
 * relative path into an absolute one.
 *
 * ### Mounts
 * While a computer can only have one hard drive and filesystem, other
 * filesystems may be "mounted" inside it. For instance, the drive peripheral
 * mounts its disk's contents at "disk/", "disk1/", etc...
 *
 * You can see which mount a path belongs to with the {@link fs.getDrive}
 * function. This returns "hdd" for the computer's main filesystem ("/"), "rom"
 * for the rom ("rom/").
 *
 * Most filesystems have a limited capacity, operations which would cause that
 * capacity to be reached (such as writing an incredibly large file) will fail.
 * You can see a mount's capacity with {@link fs.getCapacity} and the remaining
 * space with {@link fs.getFreeSpace}.
